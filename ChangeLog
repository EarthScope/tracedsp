	- Add check that the evresp() call returns requested frequencies and
	fail gracefully when this does not occur.  This can happen for
	responses expressed as Frequency-Amplitude-Phase (FAP).  The current
	convolution code expects to work within the frequency band of DC to
	Nyquist, so the interpolation within the FAP band as supported by
	evalresp is only part of the solution.

2012.355: 0.9.6

	  * Write traces after all operations have been performed
	  * Add a segment details struct to each segment to store extra stuff

2012.102: 0.9.5
